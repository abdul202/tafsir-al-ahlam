## about tafsir al ahlam

The visions that man sees in his sleep are a reflection of what has happened in his life of good or evil, and an expression of the motives and desires that he is going through in himself, but it is a way to prepare himself for the good or evil that will occur, and [tafsir al ahlam](https://www.ahlamtafsir.com/) and visions are also a means of reading what is in the unseen of things that God chooses for him in any way.
It is noticeable that there are many forums that try to explain dreams, and one may be able to explain his vision himself.

## wake up and be better, and I know my brother that not every vision is explained:
This imam of the people of Ta'wil, Ibn Serine, was asked about 100 visions of the interpretation of the Holy Qur'an, in which he does not answer anything but to say: "Allah is better at waking up, because it does not harm you what you saw in sleep, and you must know the the difference between Dreams and visions  [Dreams and visions](https://www.smartbrief.com/original/2019/01/dreams-and-visions-whats-difference), and he would answer in the course of that and say: I answer it with reason, and the thought is wrong and it strikes."


## Determine what is important in your dream:
Put your hand - from the vision - on the important ones - or what you see symbolizes any of the things of reality - or what the likes of which are related to a gospel or warning, or an alert, or a benefit in this world or in the afterlife, and put forward what other things are filled and confused and things that are not organized and that are meaningless.
